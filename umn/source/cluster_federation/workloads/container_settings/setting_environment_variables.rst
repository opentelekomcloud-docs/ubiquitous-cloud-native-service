Setting Environment Variables
=============================

Scenario
--------

An environment variable is a variable whose value can affect the way a running container will behave. You can modify environment variables even after workloads are deployed, increasing flexibility in workload configuration.

The function of setting environment variables on UCS is the same as that of specifying **ENV** in a Dockerfile.

.. important::

   After a container is started, do not modify configurations in the container. If configurations in the container are modified (for example, passwords, certificates, and environment variables of a containerized application are added to the container), the configurations will be lost after the container restarts and container services will become abnormal. An example scenario of container restart is pod rescheduling due to node anomalies.

   Configurations must be imported to a container as arguments. Otherwise, configurations will be lost after the container restarts.

Environment variables can be set in the following modes:

-  **Custom**
-  **ConfigMap**: Import all keys in a ConfigMap as environment variables.
-  **ConfigMap Key**: Import a key in a ConfigMap as the value of an environment variable. For example, if you import **configmap_value** of **configmap_key** in ConfigMap **configmap-example** as the value of environment variable **key1**, there will be an environment variable named **key1** with value **configmap_value** in the container.
-  **Secret**: Import all keys in a secret as environment variables.
-  **Secret Key**: Import the value of a key in a secret as the value of an environment variable. For example, if you import **secret_value** of **secret_key** in secret **secret-example** as the value of environment variable **key2**, an environment variable named **key2** with its value **secret_value** exists in the container.
-  **Variable/Variable Reference**: Use the field defined by a pod as the value of the environment variable, for example, the pod name.
-  **Resource Reference**: Use the field defined by a container as the value of the environment variable, for example, the CPU limit of the container.

Environment Variables
---------------------

#. Log in to the UCS console and access the federation page. When creating a workload, configure container information and select **Environment Variable**.
#. Configure environment variables.

               - name: key2                    # Added from secret key.
                 valueFrom:

                 valueFrom:
                   fieldRef:
                     apiVersion: v1
                     fieldPath: metadata.name
               - name: key4                    # Resource reference, which uses the field defined by a container as the value of the environment variable.
                 valueFrom:
                   resourceFieldRef:

               - secretRef:                    # Added from secret.
                   name: secret-example
         imagePullSecrets:
           - name: default-secret

Viewing Environment Variables
-----------------------------

If the contents of **configmap-example** and **secret-example** are as follows:

.. code-block::

   $ kubectl get configmap configmap-example -oyaml
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     configmap_key: configmap_value
   kind: ConfigMap
   ...

   $ kubectl get secret secret-example -oyaml
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     secret_key: c2VjcmV0X3ZhbHVl              # c2VjcmV0X3ZhbHVl is the value of secret_value in Base64 mode.
   kind: Secret
   ...

The environment variables in the pod are as follows:

.. code-block::

   $ kubectl get pod
   NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   env-example-695b759569-lx9jp   1/1     Running   0          17m

   $ kubectl exec env-example-695b759569-lx9jp  -- printenv
   / # env
   key=value                             # Custom environment variable.
   key1=configmap_value                  # Added from ConfigMap key.
   key2=secret_value                     # Added from secret key.
   key3=env-example-695b759569-lx9jp     # metadata.name defined by the pod.
   key4=1                                # limits.cpu defined by container1. The value is rounded up, in unit of cores.
   configmap_key=configmap_value         # Added from ConfigMap. The key value in the original ConfigMap key is directly imported.
   secret_key=secret_value               # Added from key. The key value in the original secret is directly imported.
